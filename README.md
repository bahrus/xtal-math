# \<xtal-math\>

I, \<xtal-math\>, am very well acquainted with matters mathematical.

I provide a web component wrapper around third party math libraries.

For the first one, this may be the world's first web component defined via an iframe.  [Click here to see it in action](https://bahrus.github.io/xtal-math/demo/dev.html).  Note that it progressively renders.  It is a basic calculator, based off the mostly css-based [code-pen](https://codepen.io/giana/pen/GJMBEv).

Yes, yes, a JS based version will be forthcoming for you wimps.

Sincerely,

Major General
