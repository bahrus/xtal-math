# \<xtal-math\>

I, \<xtal-math\>, am very well acquainted with matters mathematical.

I provide a web component wrapper around third party math libraries.

For the first one, this may be the world's first web component defined via an iframe.  [Click here to see it in action](https://bahrus.github.io/xtal-math/demo/dev.html).  Note that it progressively renders.  It is a basic calculator, based off the mostly css-based [code-pen](https://codepen.io/giana/pen/GJMBEv).

And not only can the iframe be used to reference the web component, you can open the reference directly as a standalone URL:  https://bahrus.github.io/xtal-math/giana-pen.html .

Yes, yes, a JS based version is also available:  xtal-math-giana-pen-js.js.
